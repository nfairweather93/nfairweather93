### Completed projects: ✅
- **[Hackathon Discord Bot](https://github.com/GrantBenR/2025Hackathon)** 🤖🎶

This discord bot was made in 24 hours during the Wright State Spring 2025 Hackathon in collaboration with [Grant Rynders](https://github.com/GrantBenR). It was made out of discord's [JDA API](https://jda.wiki/setup/intellij/) along with [Spotify's Developer API](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api) to be a bot which would take in a user's Spotify listening statistics, and insult them based on a pre-written lists of artists and responses.
