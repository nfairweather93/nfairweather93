# Hello Internet! Welcome to my GitHub Page! 👋

## My name is Nathan Fairweather, a student at Wright State pursuing my BACS with a Communications Minor 👾

### The projects I'm currently hoping to work on this semester are:
- A Java Based GUI Game
- A Password Cracker
---

### Completed projects: 
- **[Hackathon Discord Bot](https://github.com/GrantBenR/2025Hackathon)** 🤖🎶

This discord bot was made in 24 hours during the Wright State Spring 2025 Hackathon in collaboration with [Grant Rynders](https://github.com/GrantBenR). It was made out of discord's [JDA API](https://jda.wiki/setup/intellij/) along with [Spotify's Developer API](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api) to be a bot which would take in a user's Spotify listening statistics, and insult them based on a pre-written lists of artists and responses.
